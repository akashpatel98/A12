        <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an
            all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and
            internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate,
            and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:</p>
        <blockquote>&ldquo;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members.
            I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.&rdquo;</blockquote>
